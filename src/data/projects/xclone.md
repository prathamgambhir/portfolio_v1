# X-Clone | Twitter-like Social Media Platform

## Overview

X-Clone is a full-stack social media application that replicates core Twitter functionality
It allows users to create accounts, post tweets, follow/unfollow other users, like and bookmark tweets, and view personalized feeds.

The focus was on **learning full-stack development**, **state management patterns**, and **production-ready code structure**.

---

## What Users Can Do

- **Create Accounts**  
  Sign up with name, username, email, and password with secure password hashing.

- **Authentication & Security**  
  JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies for secure session handling.

- **Post Tweets**  
  Create tweets up to 300 characters with real-time feed updates.

- **Social Interactions**  
  Like/unlike tweets, bookmark tweets, and follow/unfollow other users.

- **Personalized Feeds**  
  Switch between "For You" (all tweets) and "Following" (feed from followed users).

- **Profile Management**  
  View own profile, other users' profiles, and their tweets.

- **State Management**  
  Redux Toolkit with Redux Persist for persistent state across sessions.

## Why I Built This

Twitter/X is one of the most widely used social media platforms, and building a clone is an excellent way to:

- Learn full-stack development with modern technologies  
- Understand authentication and security best practices  
- Master state management with Redux Toolkit  
- Build production-ready REST APIs with Express and TypeScript  
- Handle database operations with MongoDB and Mongoose  

X-Clone was built to strengthen my understanding of **real-world application architecture**.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT, Bcrypt, Cookie Parser
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 7
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Notifications:** React Hot Toast

---

## Key Engineering Highlights

- **Redux Toolkit** for centralized state management with persistent storage  
- **HTTP-only cookies** for secure JWT token handling  
- **Zod validation** for all API inputs on both frontend and backend  
- **Custom hooks** for data fetching (useGetTweets, useGetFollowingTweets)  
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach  
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety  
- **RESTful API design** with proper error handling  

---

## After Launch

- Successfully deployed full-stack application  
- Tested all CRUD operations for tweets and users  
- Implemented proper authentication flow  
- Built responsive UI for mobile and desktop  
- Identified improvements through self-testing  
- Strengthened full-stack development skills

## Future Improvements
 
- Real-time updates with WebSockets  
- Comments and replies system  
- Image/media upload support  
- Search functionality  
- Notifications system  
- Direct messaging  
- Profile editing  
- User search and discovery
